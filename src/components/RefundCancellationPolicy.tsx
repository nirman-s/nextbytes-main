            <p>
              Clients may request a cancellation <strong>within 2 hours of payment</strong>. In such cases, an 80% refund will be processed, and 20% will be retained as administrative and processing charges.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cancellations are not accepted once we begin working on the project or after the 2-hour window has passed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cancellations made after work has started, or beyond the 2-hour mark, are not eligible for a refund.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cancellations requested within 2 days of payment will be considered only if we fail to initiate the project or are unable to deliver the service due to unforeseen reasons from our end.

              Since we follow a full upfront payment model, refunds are subject to strict timing guidelines.

            <p>
              No refunds will be entertained once the website design or development process begins.

              We do not offer refunds for delays caused due to the client (e.g., not providing necessary content, images, or feedback on time).

              No refunds will be granted once the website or deliverables are approved or deployed.

              Refunds, if applicable, will be processed to the original payment method within 7â€“10 working days.
